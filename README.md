# About
Welcome to the LibreCalphad project. The purpose is to create a set of open CALPHAD databases and property models for use with open-source modeling software, such as [pycalphad](https://pycalphad.org/docs/latest/#). It is currently (and probably always will be) a work in progress. User discretion is advised.

# Steel Database
The steel database file (mf-steel.tdb) is decent. Known errors are documented in its frontmatter, though other issues probably exist.

The rest of the files don't really do much for now. More will be added to this at a later date.
