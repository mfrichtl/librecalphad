# Martensite Start Model
## What is this?
This model is intended to be useful for predicting the martensite-start (Ms) temperature for steels. It is far from perfect. I have done  my best to be transparent about its accuracy and limitations, but I'm sure even that falls short. All of the commercial models use proprietary thermodynamic databases, so this one is intended to be an open-source alternative that can be much more collaboratively developed. The references for the experimental data currently incorporated in the model are contained in the references.bib file. I'm sure there are more publications out there that can be incorporated. Please share them if you (yes you) are aware of them.

The most recent fitting parameters can be quickly viewed in model_parameters.md in this folder.

## Want to help?
Great! Unsolicited pull requests are _gladly_ accepted. If you don't know where to get started, but want to contribute, please just ask questions or open issues. I want to make it as easy as possible for others to contribute. If you would rather just provide a new paper with experimental data or applicable thermodynamic assessments, feel free to do that as well. I recognize the current state of this project may make it hard to know what to do, but I promise I will respond to questions.

## What's not helpful?
Unconstructive criticism in general is unhelpful. Don't just tell the model sucks because I already know it does. Tell me _how_ it sucks as specifically as possible so that I can have a chance to improve it.
