abstract     = {We report on the effects of carbon content on the martensitic transformation and its contribution to the work-hardening behavior of Fe–Mn–C steels during tensile deformation based on analysis by X-ray diffraction, electron backscatter diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Austenite/ε-martensite dual-phase Fe–17Mn–C (wt.%) steels containing different carbon contents (0.01, 0.10, 0.20 wt.%) were investigated before, during and after tensile deformation. Before deformation, the transformation of austenite to thermally induced ε-martensite on cooling was suppressed as the carbon content increases. To precisely monitor microstructural changes during deformation, stepwise loading experiments were carried out in combination with electron backscatter diffraction analysis. This approach revealed that with increasing carbon content, the kinetics of transformation of γ phase to deformation stimulated ε-martensite became faster, while that of ε-martensite to α’-martensite was sluggish. We attribute this controversial effect to an increased γ grain size by the microstructural refinement of thermally induced ε-martensite and the reduction of solid solution strengthening effects by the redistribution of solute carbon. In addition, the dependence of deformation-induced ε-martensite on the loading direction differed from that of α’-martensite, and the evolution of α’ morphology was controlled by achieving appropriate levels of strain during stepwise loading. Based on the observations at the surface and inside the bulk after deformation, insights into various deformation-driven displacive phenomena, such as the formation of α’-martensite at the nonintersecting parts of two εinitial bands, the presence of nanotwinned bundles inside austenite, cementite precipitation inside α’-martensite, and the origin of the serrated flow in strain–stress curves, were obtained. Therefore, the present study is able assist in identifying whether the deformation-induced martensitic transformation varied as a function of carbon content and the resulting fracture behavior, thereby enabling us to understand the work-hardening behavior of these steels.},

The suppressive force of carbon against ɣ → ε transformation increase linearly with an increase in its content, lowering Ms temperature and volume fraction of ε martensite. Carbon deteriorates damping capacity by reducing the area of ɣ/ε boundaries and mobility of the boundaries contributing to anelastic deformation. The reduction in the mobility of the boundaries is accelerated when carbon-containing alloy is aged at higher temperatures than room temperature. The effect of Ti on damping capacity is found to be beneficial in carbon-containing alloy, which is attributed to the depletion of carbon solute due to the formation of TiC.},

abstract     = {The influence of prior deformation of austenite (γ) on the formation of hcp (ε) martensite in Fe–Mn binary alloys during subsequent cooling was investigated. The formation of bcc (α′) lath martensite in deformed austenite was also examined for comparison. In both of the martensitic transformations to α′ in the Fe-9%Mn alloy and to ε in the Fe-16%Mn and Fe-24%Mn alloys, the transformation start temperature (Ms) monotonously decreases with increasing the reduction of austenite at 773 K. It is demonstrated that the decrease in Ms temperature for the γ→ε transformation is much larger than that for the γ→α′ transformation. The Ms temperature of the Fe-24%Mn alloy is lowered over 80 K by 40% reduction and the structure becomes fully austenitic at room temperature, whereas the decrease in Ms temperature of the Fe–9Mn alloy is 16 K. The decrease in Ms temperature by the prior deformation of austenite is quantitatively accounted for by the strengthening of austenite and the extra energy required for the transformation dislocations to advance through forest dislocations in austenite. The marked stabilization of austenite against the γ→ε martensitic transformation is mainly associated with the smaller increase in chemical driving force for the γ→ε transformation with decreasing temperature than that for the γ→α′ transformation.},

Using the microscopic technique of differentiating between tempered (black) and non-tempered (white) martensite, the quantitative effect of each of the above alloying clements on the Ar” temperature has been determined. Nickel (up to 15 per cent) was shown to decrease the Ar” temperature of a 0.45 per cent carbon steel uniformly at a rate of about 19 degrees Cent. per 1 per cent nickel; molybdenum (up to 2 per cent) neither raised nor lowered the Ar” temperatures of 0.50 per cent, 0.80 per cent, or 1.00 per cent carbon steels; similarly, silicon (up to 3.5 per cent) neither raised nor lowered the Ar” temperatures of 0.72 - 0.84 per cent carbon steels; cobalt, however, in the range from 3.4 to 7.6 per cent, raised the Ar” temperature of a 1.12 per cent carbon steel uniformly at a rate of about 19 degrees per 1 per cent cobalt.

None of these elements was found to alter in any way the kinetics of the austenite to martensite transformation as described by Greninger and Troiano for plain carbon steels; the martensite transformation remains independent of time also in the presence of these ailoying elements, and proceeds only as the steel 1s cooled through the martensite range.},

Since carbon has a very marked effect on the Ms point, the temperature of the martensite reaction can be used as a measure of the carbon content of the steel. The quench-temper procedure may therefore be used for measuring depth of decarburization (or carburization) in steels.},

The bainite start (B s ) temperatures, which define the highest temperature at which bainite can form, all lay below the T 0 loci, where ferrite and austenite of the same chemical compositions have identical free energy. The established method of calculating B s temperatures gave reasonable agreement with the experimental results. Careful study of the isothermally reacted samples revealed that Widmanstätten ferrite and bainite could both be observed, even at the beginning of the transformation, at around the B s temperature. On the other hand, the lower bainite start (LB s ) temperatures of these steels were found to be very close to the martensite start (M s ) temperatures. Silicon is considered to be responsible for depressing the LB s temperature by retarding the formation of cementite. The coformation of upper and lower bainite near the LB s temperature is also confirmed. The results indicate that the displacive formation mechanism of bainite is sustainable.},

The transformation characteristics of 29 different grades of steel and 38 heats have been determined and continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagrams have been prepared. The diagrams are first described by groups of subjects in a chronological order because the change in the chemical composition cannot be correlated in all cases with the change in transformation behaviour.

The quenching hardness can be satisfactorily described as a function of the C+N content if, taking into account the Nb, Zr, Ta, Hf fractions, a common effectiveness factor is calculated. This effectiveness factor is also integrated in the calculation of the Ms point by modifying accordingly the equation proposed by Steven and Haynes for low-alloy steels and supplemented by the summands for V and W. An equation is introduced for the calculation of the critical cooling rate for pearlite transformation which takes into account the special influence exerted by elements Cr, V, Mo, W, Ge. The comparison between calculated and measured values for Ms and Vcrit is satisfactory, except for some steels.},

Stacks of laths (i.e., single crystals of martensite) form the packets which are derived from different {111} transformation variants of austenite. Microdiffraction experiments directly allow the determination of the orientation relationships between austenite and martensite. Relative orientations of adjacent individual laths cluster about common orientations from small to large angular differences all around a common <110>M direction. The overall microstructure and orientations result from minimization of the total strain and shape de formation. Considerable accommodation occurs by de formation of laths (sometimes twinned) and austenite (sometimes tripped to twin martensite). In the meantime, microchemical analyses have shown considerable carbon segregation to the martensite-austenite interface.},

For all these alloys the tensile properties vary rapidly with temperature, but there are large differences in the value of the temperature rangeM s toM d, which strongly increases with substitution of chromium for nickel or with carbon addition. Using the node method, it is found that the intrinsic stacking fault energy in the austenite drastically increases with temperature in all the chromium-bearing alloys investigated. This variation is consistent with the observed influence of temperature on the appearance of twinning or ε martensite during plastic deformation. Very different α’ martensite morphologies can result from spontaneous and plastic deformation induced transformations, especially in Fe-20 pct Ni-7 pct Cr-type alloys where platelike and lath martensites are respectively observed. As in the case of ε martensite, the nucleation process is analyzed as a deformation mode of the material, using a dislocation model. It is then possible to account for the morphology of plastic deformation induced α’ martensite in both Fe-20 pct Ni-7 pct Cr and Fe-16 pct Cr-13 pct Ni types alloys and for the largeM s toM d range in these alloys.},

A_3 point of iron containing less than 0.003 wt% C falls gradually with the increase in cooling rate and continuously approaches a fixed temperature (maximum supercooled A_3), but in the iron containing more than 0.006 wt% C it falls discontinuously to the Ms temperature at the cooling rate of about 20, 000℃/sec. Maximum supercooled A_3 points of these irons are affected seriously by a very small content of carbon below 0.005 wt% C, falling remarkably from about 720℃ at 0.001 wt% C to about 650℃ at 0.003 wt% C with increasing carbon content. In the case of iron-nickel alloys it falls with increasing cooling rate and discontinuously by about 100℃ at a certain cooling rate which depends on the nickel content. The drop of the transformation temperature is independent of a further cooling rate. The critical cooling rate decreases from about 25, 000℃/sec at 1% Ni to about 2, 000℃/sec at 20% Ni. The Ms points of these alloys are in agreement, at higher nickel concentrations, with those reported previously, but are displaced to a lower temperature side at lower nickel concentration.},

In this study, dilatometric analysis has been combined with detailed microstructural characterization to unravel the competing mechanisms occurring during partitioning either in parallel or in succession. Three 0.4 wt.% carbon steels with varying Si contents were quenched to 150 °C for ~20% untransformed austenite, and partitioned for 10–1000 s in the temperature range 200–300 °C. The steel with low Si content (0.25 wt.%) exhibited substantial bainitic transformation during partitioning at 300 °C and only 4% retained austenite (RA) at room temperature (RT) even after 1000 s hold. In contrast, a high Si fraction (1.5 wt.%) enabled retention of ~18% austenite under similar conditions. While η-carbides precipitated within the martensite laths in the high-Si steel, cementite precipitated in the low-Si variant. Furthermore, carbide precipitation and growth were strongly suppressed by high Si content. Secondary martensite formation occurred from carbon-enriched austenite during final cooling, irrespective of Si-content. Results illustrate that Si retards austenite decomposition at higher partitioning temperatures but does not improve carbon partitioning at lower temperatures.},

abstract     = {The change in MS temperature of γ→ε martensitic transformation with austenite grain size (AGS) has been investigated in relation to the stacking fault energy (SFE) in an Fe–18%Mn alloy. With increasing AGS, the MS temperature increases steeply up to 35 μm, and gradually increases in larger grains. The SFE, on the other hand, decreases abruptly until 35 μm, over which it is slightly lowered. A good linear relationship is established between MS temperature and inverse of SFE, i.e. stacking fault probability (SFP). This result suggests that the variation of MS temperature with AGS depends strongly on the change in SFE.},

Incorporating the theory of solid solution hardening, we describe the composition dependence of the athermal frictional work for martensitic interface motion governing the kinetics of barrierless heterogeneous nucleation. The available data suggests that the composition dependence of the athermal frictional work is of the same form as that for slip deformation. We have evaluated the athermal strengths of 14 alloying elements AI, C, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, N, Nb, Ni, Si, Ti, V and W from the experimental data. Except for A1, Ni and Co, the athermal strengths of the common substitutional alloying elements are similar in magnitude, while the interstitial solutes C and N exert a stronger influence. Previously proposed superposition laws are used to account for the presence of multiple solutes having different athermal strengths. With an improved assessment of the magnetic parameters of alloy systems, the model predicts Ms temperatures within +40 K for Ms > 300 K where thermal contributions to the frictional work can be neglected.},

With refining γ grain size, the formation of ε tends to be suppressed and the starting temperature of γ-ε transformation is also lowered. In the grain size range below 30 μm, the transformation is markedly suppressed.
In small γ grains below 30 μm, one variant of ε plates go through a γ grain from one grain boundary to the other of the opposite side. When the size of γ grains is sufficiently larger than 30 μm, however, the microstructure changes to a different one in which a lot of ε plates intersect each other within a large γ grain. In this case, ε plates were formed on four {111}γ planes in the Shoji-Nishiyama relation. The growing process of ε plates in a large γ grain is as follows: When one ε plate grows to a certain critical size, branching takes place at the tip of pre-formed ε plate in order to reduce the elastic coherent stress at γ/ε interface, so that austenite can smoothly transform to ε by the chain reaction through branching of ε. When the γ grain size was not large enough to the critical size of ε plate, the growth of ε should be stopped by grain boundaries before the branching of ε takes place. This leads to the suppressive effect in γ-ε transformation by γ grain refining.},

The structures were chmacterized by transmission electron microscopy. The transformation temperatures for each alloy exhibited the progressive decrease to a constant value with increasing cooling rate which has been shown to be characteristic of several iron binary systems. The corresponding structures were found to become increasingly finer in scale with increasing cooling rate and solute content, but to remain essentially equiaxed in character. In all the materials except the highpurity iron and one of the alloys, an additional and lower transformation temperature than the constant value for the equiaxed structures was observed. The structures of specimens which transformed at these lower temperatures (only single thermal wrests were observed in any given run) were martensitic and consisted of mrays of fine ferrite laths which vmied in size and morphology with changing solute content. The factors controlling the nature of these transformations are discussed. The composition dependence of the martensitic transformation temperature, ME, in Fe-Cr alloys together with those reported for other iron binary systems indicate that MB for pure iron is some 700°c, rather than the values of 550" and 760'~ reported previously. This conclusion is further supported by the results of a compmison of the thermodynamics of martensite formation in several systems.},

It is demonstrated that carbon enrichment of the remaining austenite due to intercritical annealing of Fe-0.46C and Fe-0.66C does not only depress the start temperature for martensite, but also slows the progress of the transformation with temperature compared to full austenitization. In contrast, such a change of kinetics is not observed when the remaining austenite of lean-Si steel Fe-0.80C is stabilized due to a partial transformation to bainite, which suggests that the stabilization is not of a chemical but of a mechanical nature. The growth of bainite and martensite is accompanied by a shape change at the microstructural scale, which leads to plastic deformation and thus strengthening of the surrounding austenite. Based on this stabilizing mechanism, the athermal transformation kinetics is rationalized by balancing the increase in driving force corresponding to a temperature decrease with the increase in strain energy required for the formation of martensite in the strengthened remaining austenite.},

Yet, this dependence is frequently ignored. The present study investigates the role of the prior austenite grain size (PAGS) in the martensitic transformation in low-carbon steels. The transformation kinetics was experimentally studied for PAGS in the range from 6 to 185 μm and theoretically analysed based on the nucleation rate and the thermodynamic balance between the chemical driving force and the resistance exerted by the austenite against the progress of the transformation. It is observed that grain refinement shifts the martensite start temperature (MS) to lower values and accelerates the transformation rate at initial stages. At a later stage, when approximately 30% martensite has formed, the transformation rate decreases rapidly for small PAGS, whereas higher rates are maintained in coarse-grained microstructures. The change in martensite formation rate with the grain size depends on the nuclei density and on the austenite strength. This research enables an optimised selection of processing parameters for the design of ultra-high strength steels that require the formation of a controlled fraction of martensite.},

which is considered to be the activation. enelJ;y Jar diffusion qf carbon in
martensite, is strongly dependent on the preci/Jitated carbon content , rather
than on the carbon content in solution qf as-quenched martensite.
T he activation eMrgy Jar the .first stage-tempering of Ihe ferrous mar-
tensite can be represented by the following equations:
